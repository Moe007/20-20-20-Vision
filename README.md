# 20-20-20-Vision
20/20/20 Vision is a chrome extension that simply just reminds you to give 
your eyes a break from your computer screen as per the 20/20/20 eye care 
rule, which states: "For every 20 minutes spent using a screen, you should 
try to look away at something that is approximately 20 feet away from you 
for a total of 20 seconds."

This rule is essential for everyone today, as almost everyone uses a 
computer screen everyday. Following this rule would mean less eye strain, 
better eyesight and less headaches.
